<b>How to play Sudoku</b> </br>
The rules for Sudoku are simple: In Sudoku, the goal is to fill the 9 x 9 board with numbers from 1-9. However, the same number can only occur once within the same column, row, and 3 x 3 subgrid. If you complete the board while following these rules, you win the game. </br> </br>

<b>How to navigate our Sudoku game</b> </br>
<i> MR. K CHEAT: If you want to see the final page without solving the puzzle, just keep pressing hint until it's all filled in, and then press Submit, Check Errors, or Number of Errors. All should work. </i> </br>
The first page is IntroWindow.java. This is the one you want to compile and run. You may also jump straight to SudokuWindow.java, assuming you compiled and ran this, but IntroWindow allows you to pick a username and difficulty level, and gives an option for entering a seed to generate a specific puzzle.
Once onto the SudokuWindow window (the one with the actual Sudoku game and buttons), pressing the Help button will open another pop-up window that describes how to play Sudoku and the functions of all the buttons present.</br> </br>
<b> Development Log </b> </br>
1/3: first created the Sudoku and SudokuWindow java files</br>
1/5: Connected Sudoku and SudokuWindow, started writing methods that we needed</br>
1/7: Britni made the basic SudokuWindow GUI. We both struggled with branching and merge conflicts, it took a while for us to fully figure them out.</br>
1/8: Jeremy was able to write SudokuWindow so it opened a blank window and fixed merge conflicts, and put in a real solution for testing purposes. Britni implemented setEditable() and added more buttons to pane and allowed data to access Sudoku. </br>
1/9: Britni began to add values to the Sudoku puzzle and established connection with puzzle from Sudoku(). Made some values empty, others show in orignal setup of puzzle. Still using set Sudoku puzzle. </br>
1/10: Jeremy added more puzzles and kept creating button functionality. Fixed check answers button and changed sizing so all buttons would appear.</br>
1/11: Jeremy fixed bugs for Create Puzzle button, Britni trying to get Sudoku creator algorithm. STILL CANT GET MINIGRIDS TO APPEAR </br>
1/13: Realize algorithm for Sudoku generator is impossible w/o backtracking. Will focus on adding puzzles manually. </br>
1/14: Jeremy used createMatteBorder() to add minigrids to the puzzle, cleaned up how it looked visually, added hint button. Britni added HelpWindow to show users how to use our project, changed placement of buttons. Both of us fixed bugs. </br>
1/16: Britni removed obsolete buttons, created Number of Errors and reset buttons. We hope to implement a timer, add start and end windows, and create seed generators for the puzzles.
1/17: Jeremy began experimenting with timer and added more puzzles. Britni added error and submit windows </br>
1/18: Jeremy caught errors and wrote more of the timer function (but can't implement it). Britni added Welcome, Error, Winning window, still not 100% functional. </br>
1/19: Jeremy added endpage window if you win and kept working on timer. Britni created IntroWindow. </br>
1/20: Jeremy began adding random seeds and caught a bug in hint button. Britni tried the timer and it now checks the actual time. We are still working on getting that functional. Britni added usernames and difficulty levels. </br>
1/21: We are just finishing up and working on getting the random seed generator and timer working. UPDATE: Jeremy got both functions working, Britni continued to check for bugs and wrote a Delay Window when creating a new puzzle. </br>

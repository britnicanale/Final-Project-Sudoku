<b>How to play Sudoku</b> </br>
The rules for Sudoku are simple: In Sudoku, the goal is to fill the 9 x 9 board with numbers from 1-9. However, the same number can only occur once within the same column, row, and 3 x 3 subgrid. If you complete the board while following these rules, you win the game. </br> </br>
The first page is IntroWindow.java. This is the one you want to compile and run. You may also jump straight to SudokuWindow.java, assuming you compiled and ran this, but IntroWindow allows you to pick a username and difficulty level.
Once onto the SudokuWindow window (the one with the actual Sudoku game and buttons), pressing the Help button will open another pop-up window that describes how to play Sudoku and the functions of all the buttons present.
